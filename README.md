# Revolt Motors Voice Chatbot (Clone)

This is a voice chatbot web app made to work just like the one on the Revolt Motors website. You can talk to it, interrupt it while it's speaking, and get fast responses — just like the original.

---

##  What I Built

I recreated the “Rev” voice assistant (found on [live.revoltmotors.com](https://live.revoltmotors.com)) using:

- **Node.js + Express** for the backend
- **Gemini Live API** for real-time voice replies
- **Web Speech API** for voice input and output on the browser

It’s fast, supports multiple languages, and reacts to user interruptions mid-conversation — just like the real one.

##  How to Use (Locally)

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/revolt-voice-chatbot.git
cd revolt-voice-chatbot/server
````

### 2. Install backend packages

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Add your API key

Make a `.env` file in the `server` folder and paste this:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
PORT=8080
```

> Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
node index.js
```

Now the server will run at: `http://localhost:8080`
